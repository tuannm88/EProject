        <h3 class="padding-30">Colosseum</h3>
        <!-- <hr> -->
        <p class="padding-40">The Colosseum, first known as Amphitheatrum Flavium in Latin or Anfitea ash Flavio in Italian, later known as Colosseum or Colosseo, is a large amphitheater in the city of Rome. The storage capacity at the time of construction was 50,000 spectators. The arena was used by gladiators and slaves of POW origin to compete and perform to the public. The arena was built around 70-80 AD under the emperor Vespasian. It was the largest structure built in the Roman Empire and was completed in 80 AD under Titus, with many modifications under the emperor Domitian.
            The Colosseum has remained in use for nearly 500 years, with documented evidence of a 6th-century battle - long after the fall of the Roman Empire in 476. In addition to being used as a place for martial arts, it is also used as a battle arena. used as public performances, mock sea drills, hunting, classical plays. This building gradually fell out of use as a recreation center in the Middle Ages. Later, the arena was used as a house, shop, church, execution ground...
            Although now largely abandoned due to earthquakes and stone-robbing, the Colosseum has long been considered a symbol of the Roman Empire and is one of the finest surviving examples of Roman architecture. It is a fascinating attraction of Rome and still has many connections with the Catholic Church. Every year on Good Friday, the pope still presides over the Way of the Cross in the Colosseo.

        <h4 class="padding-30">1. History</h4>
        <p class="padding-40"> Construction of the Colosseum began under Emperor Vespasian around AD 70-72, and was completed in AD 80 under Titus. it was later adjusted during the reign of King Domitian (81–96). The site selected was a flat piece of land in a valley between the Caeli Hills and the Esquiline Hills and the Palatine Hills, through which a canal flows. By 62 AD, the site was densely inhabited and abandoned after the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64 followed by Nero taking over most of the area as his own domain. he built the monumental Domus Aurea on this site, in front of which he created an artificial lake surrounded by halls, gardens and gates. The existing aqueduct Aqua Claudia was expanded to supply water to the area and the colossal bronze Colosseum of Nero was built near the entrance to the Domus Aurea.
            The area was transformed under Vespasian successors. Although the Colosseum was preserved, much of the Domus Aurea was damaged. The lake was filled and the land was reused for the new Flavian Amphitheater. gladiator schools and other ancillary buildings were built nearby within the grounds of the former Domus Aurea site. According to reconstructed inscriptions found in the area, "the emperor Vespasian ordered the construction of this amphitheatre from the spoils of his people". This is thought to refer to the large amount of fortune the Romans plundered after their victory in the Great Jewish Revolution in 70.
            Middle Ages
            The Colosseum underwent major changes during the Middle Ages. A small church was built inside the arena in the late 6th century, and the arena became a cemetery. Much of the space below the steps was used as accommodation or craft workshops, and people continued to rent houses there until the 12th century.
            
            In 1349, a great earthquake collapsed the entire outer wall of the south face. A large part of the stone is used for the construction of palaces, churches, dispensaries and other buildings, the outer layer of marble and marble is used for the lime kilns, while the iron and copper cores are not. stolen.
            Modern
            Colosseum of 1757 engraved by Giovanna Battista Piranesi
            During the 16th and 17th centuries, church officials sought to exploit the Colosseum. Pope Sixtus V (1585–1590) planned to turn the building into a factory to create jobs for the unemployed in Rome, although this was unsuccessful through his early death. In 1671, the Cardinal y Altieri authorized its use for bullfighting; but met with fierce opposition, so the idea was not successful.

        <h4 class="padding-30">2. Features of the project</h4>
        <p class="padding-40">Dimensions of Colosseo: height: 57 m, length: 188 m, width: 158m.

            Unlike previous arenas, this one is a free-standing structure, built on flat ground rather than leaning against a hill or natural depression. The exterior wall was originally 545 m in circumference and required 100,000 m³ of travertine held together by 300 tons of iron clamps. It could hold up to 50,000 to 80,000 people, and was so well designed that each person could out of this building within minutes. The secret lies in the skillful use of the arches, the corridors and the steps leading to the seats. The arches above the ground floor provide 80 crowded entrances, each numbered to help guests find their seats. A giant canvas for sun and rain is often stretched over it, and during night shows, a giant iron chandelier hangs above the arena. However, over the centuries, it has been damaged by natural influences (earthquakes). The northern perimeter of the Colosseum is still intact with traces of 19th-century restoration. What remains of Coloseo today is the original wall as it was when it was built.
