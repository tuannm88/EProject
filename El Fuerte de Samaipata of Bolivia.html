        <h3 class="padding-30">El Fuerte de Samaipata</h3>
        <!-- <hr> -->
        <p class="padding-40">El Fuerte de Samaipata or Fort Samaipata, also known simply as "El Fuerte", is a Pre-Columbian archaeological site and UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Florida Province, Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia.[1] It is situated in the eastern foothills of the Bolivian Andes and is a popular tourist destination for Bolivians and foreigners alike. It is served by the nearby town of Samaipata. The archaeological site at El Fuerte is unique as it encompasses buildings of three different cultures: Chanè, Inca, and Spanish.[2]

            Although called a fort, Samaipata had also a religious, ceremonial, and residential function. Its construction was probably begun by the Chané, a pre-Inca people of Arawak origin. There are also ruins of an Inca plaza and residences, dating from the late 15th and early 16th centuries as the Inca empire expanded eastward from the Andes highlands into the sub-tropical foothills. Chané, Inca, and Spanish all suffered raids from Guarani (Chiriguano) warriors who also settled in the region. The Guarani conquered the plains and valleys of Santa Cruz and occupied the Samaipata area. The Guaranis dominated the region well into the Spanish colonial period.[3]
            
            The Spaniards built a settlement at Samaipata fort, and there are remains of buildings of typical Arab Andalusian architecture. The Spaniards soon abandoned the fort and moved to a nearby valley, establishing the town of Samaipata in 1618.[4]

        <h4 class="padding-30">1. Incas</h4>
        <p class="padding-40"> The site of Samaipata was used as a residential and ceremonial area around 300 AD by Chané of the Mojocoyas period (200 to 800 AD). They began to shape the large rock that was the ceremonial center of the Samaipata ruins. [5]
            According to 17th-century Spanish chronicles, the Inca Diego Felipe de Alcaya, probably towards the end of the Tupac Yupanqui dynasty (reigned 1471-1493), began to incorporate the Samaipata area into the empire. A relative of Yupanqui named Guacane led an Inca army to the area and with elaborate gifts persuaded the local chieftain, whose title was Grigota, and his 50,000 subjects. subject to Inca rule. Guacane established its capital at Samaipata or Sabay Pata atop the mountain at 1,900 meters (6,200 ft). Samaipata means "peak of rest" in the Quechua language spoken by the Incas. [6]
            Samaipata was an administrative, ceremonial and religious center of the Incas. As with other Inca administrative centers on the empire's borders (such as Oroncota), Samaipata was defended by outer fortresses. One was about 50 km (31 mi) to the east called La Fortaleza. The ruins of the fort are perched atop a mountaintop overlooking the lowlands surrounding present-day Santa Cruz. [7] Another fortress. Unknown location, known as Guanacopampa guarding a mine in Saypurú or Caypurum, location also unknown. [8] The Samaipata area was one of the most isolated and easternmost regions of the Inca Empire.
            According to Alcaya's account, Guacane and Grigota were killed in an attack by the Guaraní in Eastern Bolivia known to the Spaniards as Chiriguanos. The Chiriguanos were advancing from the lowlands into the foothills of the Andes. An Incas counterattack failed to destroy the Chiriguanos, who still settled in Samaipata and its vicinity. An Inca building destroyed by fire at Samaipata makes this story believable. [9] The date of the war is uncertain, although many authorities date the beginning of Chiriguano's attacks on the Inca's eastern border to the 1520s. [10]
            The Spaniards, along with Inca supporters, may have used Samaipata as a fortress and base camp as early as the 1570s, but formal Spanish settlement began in 1615 during when the Chiriguanos were still under threat. A Spanish house lies among the ruins. [11]

        <h4 class="padding-30">2. The site</h4>
        <p class="padding-40">TThe Samaipata archaeological site of about 20 hectares (49 acres) is divided into two parts: a ceremonial sector and an administrative/residential sector. Some of the construction of the Inca were built on earlier structures of the Chané.
            The ceremonial sector is in the northern part of the site. It is about 220 metres (720 ft) by 60 metres (200 ft) and consists mostly of a large rock saddle almost completely covered with carvings of both Inca and pre-Inca origin. The carvings include a variety of geometric and animal figures, walls, niches, and long canal-like carvings called "the spine of the serpent" or "el cascabel" (the rattle). Although not the most visually spectacular, the most important part of the ceremonial sector is the "coro de los sacerdotes" (choir of the priests) at the highest point of the rock. This consists of 18 niches, probably used as seats for individuals, carved into the rock. At the bottom of the rock are 21 carved rectangular niches which may have served as residences for priests or for the storage of ceremonial items. Other niches and alcoves are scattered around the ruin.[12]
            The residential and administrative center makes up the southern part of the site. Samaipata may have been an Incan provincial capital and has all the infrastructure associated with that status.[13] The most prominent feature is a large trapezoidal plaza about 100 metres (330 ft) on each side bordered on the south by a "kallanka," a rectangular building typical of Inca cities and symbolizing Incan political power. The kallanka, 70 metres (230 ft) in length and 16 metres (52 ft) wide was used for public gatherings, feasts, and housing visitors and soldiers. The kallanka at Samaipata is the second largest in Bolivia, but apparently construction was interrupted as the drainage canal and thatched roof were not completed.[14]
            Also in this sector is the Acllahuasi, a nunnery for the sequestered women called Aclla, who were chosen to weave textiles, become wives of Inca nobles, participate in ceremonies, and, on occasion, be sacrificed in religious ceremonies. The existence of an Acllahuasi was typical of important Inca settlements.[15]
