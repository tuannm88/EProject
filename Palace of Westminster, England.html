        <h3 class="padding-30">Palace of Westminster</h3>
        <!-- <hr> -->
        <p class="padding-40">The Palace of Westminster is the meeting place of the two Houses of Parliament, the Senate and the House of Commons. Known informally as the Houses of Parliament after its occupants, the palace is located on the north bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster, Central London, England, close to the government buildings in Whitehall .
            Its name derives from neighboring Westminster Abbey, which may refer to a number of historic structures but most commonly the Old Palace, a medieval complex that was demolished. largely destroyed after a fire in 1834 or the new Palace replaced the present one. The palace is owned by the monarchy and is used for national ceremonial purposes, most notably the Opening of Parliament, but remains in its original state as a royal residence. A committee appointed by both houses will manage the building and report to the presidents of both houses.
            The first royal palace built on the site dates back to the 11th century, and Westminster became the main residence of the kings of England until a fire consumed the royal apartments in 1512, after The nearby Whitehall Palace was established as a new residence. The remains of Westminster continue to serve as the seat of the British Parliament, meeting there since the 13th century, as well as the seat of the Royal Courts of Justice based in and around Westminster hall. . In 1834, an even greater fire than before devastated the Houses of Parliament, and the only significant surviving medieval structures are Westminster Hall, the verandah. St. Stephen, Catacombs of St. Mary's Chapel, and Jewel Tower.
            In the competition to rebuild the Palace that followed, architect Charles Barry won with the design of new buildings in the Neo-Gothic style, especially inspired by the 14th-century English Gothic style- 16. The remainder of the Old Palace (with the exception of the individually existing Jewel Tower) was incorporated into a much larger replacement than before, with more than 1,100 rooms symmetrically surrounding two courtyards totaling 112,476 square feet of floor space. (1,210,680 square feet).[1] A portion of the new 3.24-hectare (8-acre) new Palace that extends into the Thames is the site of the construction of a nearly 300-meter (980 ft) façade known as the River Front. Augustus Pugin, a leading authority on Gothic architecture and style, assisted Barry and the interior design of the palace. Construction began in 1840 and lasted for 30 years, with massive delays and cost overruns, as well as the deaths of both leading architects. The structures were favorably furnished until the 20th century. Massive conservation work has been done since then to avoid the impact of London's air pollution and major repairs after the World War. the second, including the rebuilding of the Civilian Chamber damaged by the bombing in 1941.
            
            The palace is one of the political centers of Great Britain. "Westminster" has become a nickname for the UK Parliament and Government. The Westminster system was born in memory of the name of the palace. The Elizabeth Tower, commonly known by its main bell, Big Ben, has become an iconic landmark of London and the UK in general, one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city, and is a symbol of Parliamentary democracy. Tsar Nikolai I of Russia called it "a dream in the rock". The Palace of Westminster has been a Grade I listed building since 1970 and has been part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.

        <h4 class="padding-30">1. History</h4>
        <p class="padding-40">The site of the Palace of Westminster was strategically important throughout the Middle Ages, as it stood on the banks of the River Thames. Known in the Middle Ages as Thorney Island, the site may have been first used as a royal residence by Knud the Great during his reign from 1016 to 1035. Edward the Propaganda Confess of Faith, England's penultimate Anglo-Saxon king built a royal palace on Thorney Island, just west of the City of London, around the same time he built Westminster Abbey (1045–1050 ). Thorney Island and its surroundings soon became known as Westminster, taken from "west" and "minster" (cathedral or cathedral). Both the buildings used by Anglo-Saxon and those used by William I are now defunct. The oldest surviving part of the Palace is Westminster Hall dating from the reign of William I's successor King William II (1087–1100).

            The Palace of Westminster functioned as the main residence of the British monarchs in the late Middle Ages. The predecessors of Parliament, the council of Anglo-Saxon kings and nobles in England (Witenagemot) and the Royal Council (Curia regis) gathered in Westminster Hall (although they followed the House of Commons). king when he moved to other palaces). Simon de Montfort's Parliament consisting of representatives of the major towns met at the Palace in 1265. Frederic William Maitland's Model Parliament officially met in the palace in 1295, and virtually all the The British Parliaments that followed and after 1707 both met at the Palace.
            Sir Charles Barry's collaborative design for the Palace of Westminster uses the Perpendicular Gothic style, which was popular during the 15th century and returned during the Gothic revival of the 19th century. Barry was a classical architect, but he was aided by the Gothic architect Augustus Pugin. Westminster Hall, which was built in the 11th century and survived the fire of 1834, was incorporated in Barry's design. Pugin was displeased with the result of the work, especially with the symmetrical layout designed by Barry; he famously remarked, "All Grecian, sir; Tudor details on a classic body".
            In 1839 Charles Barry toured Britain, looking at quarries and buildings, with a committee which included two leading geologists and a stonecarver. They selected Anston, a sand-coloured magnesian limestone quarried in the villages of Anston, South Yorkshire, and Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire.[37] Two quarries were chosen from a list of 102, with the majority of the stone coming from the former. A crucial consideration was transportation, achieved on water via the Chesterfield Canal, the North Sea, and the rivers Trent and Thames.[38] Furthermore, Anston was cheaper, and "could be supplied in blocks up to four feet thick and lent itself to elaborate carving".
            
            Barry's New Palace of Westminster was rebuilt using the sandy-coloured Anston limestone. However, the stone soon began to decay due to pollution and the poor quality of some of the stone used. Although such defects were clear as early as 1849, nothing was done for the remainder of the 19th century even after much studying. During the 1910s, however, it became clear that some of the stonework had to be replaced. In 1928 it was deemed necessary to use Clipsham stone, a honey-coloured limestone from Rutland, to replace the decayed Anston. The project began in the 1930s but was halted by the outbreak of the Second World War, and completed only during the 1950s. By the 1960s pollution had again begun to take its toll. A stone conservation and restoration programme to the external elevations and towers began in 1981, and ended in 1994.
            
            Instead of one main entrance, the Palace features separate entrances for the different user groups of the building. The Sovereign's Entrance, at the base of the Victoria Tower, is located in the south-west corner of the Palace and is the starting point of the royal procession route, the suite of ceremonial rooms used by the monarch at State Openings of Parliament. This consists of the Royal Staircase, the Norman Porch, the Robing Room, the Royal Gallery and the Prince's Chamber, and culminates in the Lords Chamber, where the ceremony takes place. Members of the House of Lords use the Peers' Entrance in the middle of the Old Palace Yard front, which is covered by a stone carriage porch and opens to an entrance hall. A staircase from there leads, through a corridor, to the Prince's Chamber.
            
            Members of Parliament enter their part of the building from the Members' Entrance in the south side of New Palace Yard. Their route passes through a cloakroom in the lower level of the Cloisters and eventually reaches the Members' Lobby directly south of the Commons Chamber. From New Palace Yard, access can also be gained to the Speaker's Court and the main entrance of the Speaker's House, located in the pavilion at the north-east corner of the Palace
            
            St Stephen's Entrance, roughly in the middle of the building's western front, is the entrance for members of the public. From there, visitors walk through a flight of stairs to St Stephen's Hall, location of a collection of marbles, which includes Somers Mansfield, Hampden,Walpole, Pitt and Fox. Traversal of this hallway brings them to the octagonal Central Lobby, the hub of the Palace. This hall is flanked by symmetrical corridors decorated with fresco paintings, which lead to the ante-rooms and debating chambers of the two Houses: the Members' Lobby and Commons Chamber to the north, and the Peers' Lobby and Lords Chamber to the south. Another mural-lined corridor leads east to the Lower Waiting Hall and the staircase to the first floor, where the river front is occupied by a row of 16 committee rooms. Directly below them, the libraries of the two Houses overlook the Thames from the principal floor.
