        <!-- <hr> -->
        <p class="padding-40">Turtle Tower (Vietnamese: Tháp Rùa), also called Tortoise Tower is a small tower in the middle of Hoan Kiem Lake (Sword Lake) in central Hanoi, Vietnam.</p>
        <img src="./assets/img/image-Turtle Tower/Thap_Rua.jpg" alt="">

        <h4 class="padding-30">1. History</h4>
        <p class="padding-40">The island was first used as a fishing site. In the 1400s, under Lê Thanh Tong a tower was erected to improve the comfort of the king's fishing. In the 17th and 18th centuries, under the Restored Lê dynasty, the Trịnh lords had Ta Vong Temple built on the islet. In the 18th century, under the Nguyễn lords the temple disappeared.
            In 1886, while Vietnam was occupied by the French, a musician who was secretly working for the French, received permission from the government to build a tower in the middle of Hoan Kiem Lake in honor of Lê Lợi, one of the most famous figures of Vietnamese history and one of its greatest heroes. Legends surrounding his life involving the sword, Thuận Thiên and Hoan Kiem turtle are associated with Hoan Kiem Lake and the island.
            The musician planned to secretly bury his father within the tower. Residents of the city discovered his plans and removed his father's body from the structure. The three-story tower was still completed and was originally named Ba Ba Kim Tower.
            In 1890, the French erected a miniature Statue of Liberty on top of the tower. In 1945, after French control was overthrown, the Vietnamese government had the statue removed.

        <h4 class="padding-30">2. Mythology</h4>
        <p class="padding-40">Stories of the Hoàn Kiếm turtle began in the fifteenth century with Lê Lợi, who became an emperor of Vietnam and founder of the Lê Dynasty. According to legend, Lê Lợi had the sword named Heaven's Will given to him by the Golden Turtle God, Kim Quy.
            One day, not long after the war and the Chinese had accepted Vietnam's independence, Lê Lợi was out boating on the lake. Suddenly the Golden Turtle God surfaced, prompting Lê Lợi to return Heaven's Will and thank the divine turtle for its help. The Golden Turtle God took back the sword and disappeared into depths of the lake. Lê Lợi then renamed the lake Hoàn Kiếm Lake (or Hồ Gươm), meaning “The Lake of the Returned Sword.”

        <h4 class="padding-30">3. Rediscovery</h4>
        <p class="padding-40">Near the northern shore of Hoàn Kiếm Lake lies Jade Island, on which the Temple of the Jade Mountain is located. On June 2, 1967, a Hoàn Kiếm turtle died from injuries caused by an abusive fisherman that was ordered to net the turtle and carry it, but instead hit the turtle with a crowbar. The turtle's body was preserved and placed on display in the temple. That particular specimen weighed 200 kg (440 lbs) and measured 1.9 metres long (6 ft 3 in). Until that time, no one was sure if the species still lived.
            On March 24, 1998, an amateur cameraman caught the creature on video, conclusively proving the elusive creatures still survived in the lake. Prior to its recent rediscovery, the turtles were thought to be only a legend and were classified as cryptozoological.
            In 2000, professor Hà Đình Đức gave the Hoàn Kiếm turtle the scientific name Rafetus leloii. This nomenclature has been rejected by other herpetologists who assert leloii is synonymous with swinhoei.
            By the Spring of 2011, concerned with the Hoàn Kiếm specimen's more frequent than usual surfacing, and apparent lesions on its body, the city authorities started attempts to capture the giant reptile of Hoàn Kiếm Lake, and take it for medical treatment. On February 9, a local turtle farm operator, KAT Group, was chosen to prepare a suitable net to capture the sacred animal. The first attempt, on March 8, 2011, failed, as the turtle made a hole in the net with which the workers tried to capture it, and escaped. An expert commented, “It’s hard to catch a large, very large soft-shell turtle.” On March 31, in an unusual act, the turtle went to the shore to bask in the sun. Finally, on April 3, 2011, the giant turtle was netted in an operation that involved members of the Vietnamese military. The captured creature was put into an enclosure constructed on an island in the middle of the lake, for study and treatment. According to the scientists involved, the turtle was determined to be female, and genetic research suggested it was distinct from the R. swinhoei turtles in China, and Đồng Mô in Vietnam. 
            Some witnesses believe there are at least two or three turtles living in Hoàn Kiếm Lake and that the “smaller” one appears more regularly. Đức rejected these reports.
            The last known Hoan Kiem turtle was found dead on 19 January 2016.
